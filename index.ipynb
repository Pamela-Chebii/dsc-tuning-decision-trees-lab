Pruning reduces the size of decision trees by removing nodes of the tree that do not provide much predictive power to classify instances. Decision trees are the most susceptible out of all the machine learning algorithms to overfitting and effective pruning can reduce this likelihood. \n","\n","## Objectives\n","\n","In this lab you will: \n","\n","- Determine the optimal hyperparameters for a decision tree model and evaluate the model performance"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Import necessary libraries\n","\n","Let's first import the libraries you'll need for this lab.
